# XML schema definition for ISO 23386-compliant provision of properties and groups of properties

The XML Schema Definition (XSD) can be used to create properties and groups of properties that conform to the data schema introduced in ISO 23386 version 2020. The information elements created in this way can be created, maintained, and linked using the methods described in ISO 23386 to create interconnected data dictionaries.


# Excel-Tool for property aquisition

At the Chair of Computing in Engineering, an Excel tool was developed in the course of early research projects on the topic of property recording, which enables the recording of large quantities of properties and groups of properties at once. All mandatory and some optional attributes from the data schema of the standard can be captured via the tables of the workbook. A rudimentary recording of the relationships between properties and groups of properties is also possible via the Excel tool.
